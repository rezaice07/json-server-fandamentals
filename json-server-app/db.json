      "description": "Ukraine declared a state of emergency on Wednesday and told its citizens in Russia to flee, while Moscow began evacuating its Kyiv embassy in the latest ominous signs for Ukrainians who fear an all-out Russian military onslaught.      Shelling intensified at the line of contact in eastern Ukraine, where Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised the independence of two Moscow-backed rebel regions this week and has ordered the deployment of Russian troops as \"peacekeepers\". But there was still no clear indication of whether he plans to follow that up with a massed assault on his neighbour by tens of thousands of troops gathered near Ukraine's borders. The uncertainty has roiled financial markets but oil prices eased on Wednesday, global stocks broke a four-day slide and demand for safe-haven assets waned as Western leaders and Ukraine awaited Putin's next move.",

They are Rubi Akter, 27, Jesmin Akter, 18 and Mst Rozina, 16,  daughters of late Abdul Rashid from Golaghata village of Barguna’s Bamna upazila.      They vowed to continue their hunger strike until they get back their ancestral property.      Elder sister Rubi Akter said she along with her two younger sisters went to Chattogram after their parents died. She took a job at an apparel factory and helped her two sisters in study.       When they returned home in 2019, they found other people occupied their ancestral property in nexus with the influential persons. At that time, they were also ousted from their home. Since then, they have been living in inhuman condition, she added.      Rubi Akter said, \"My younger sisters studied living at a house of distant relative. I came home three years ago and found my uncles have grabbed all properties of our father in nexus with local influential persons.\"      \"Our uncles told us they bought our land throng auction. But we went to the land office of Bamna upazil and learned our land was not auctioned,\" she added.",
